## How does a Hub differ from a web site?
HUBzero is a website built with regular tools that a website uses but HUBzero builds upon the infrastructure to create an environment in which scientists, researches and students can have access to reliable tools and distribution of their information and findings. Tools utilized to create a hub are the same ones to create a website and they are open source packages: Apache web server, PHP web scripting, Joomla content management system, and a MySQL database for storing content and usage statistics. 

## Features
HUBzero comes default with many features that users might find exploitable. Such features enhance the user’s ability to collaborate with one another for the purposes of research and education. With these collaborative features build into the PolarEDHub, users will be able to explore the hub with ease and quickly become part of the team within this online community. 

## Strumenti di simulazione interattiva
The main service of a hub is its capability to distribute interactive, graphical simulation tools through a web browser. In a world where researchers utilize portals and cyber-environments, this ability is simply obsolete.  HUBzero has access to tools in a hub that are interactive; such as, users can zoom in and out of a graph, rotate a molecule, and analyze isosurfaces of a 3D shape, all without having to refresh the wed page.  Researchers can visualize results without having to reserve time on a supercomputer or even wait for a batch job to engage. Users can deploy new tools without having to rewrite codes for the web. 

The HUBzero substructure includes a tool execution and delivery mechanism based on Virtual Network Computing (VNC).   This means any tool that uses a graphical user interface can be installed on the hub and deployed within a few hours. For older tools and codes without a graphical interface, users are able to use the Rappture toolkit that comes with HUBzero to quickly create an interface. The Rappture interface was created to assist users in setting up jobs and visualizing results. These jobs can be sent off to the TeraGrid, the Open Science Grid, and other participating cluster resources.

## Mechanism for Uploading New Resources
HUBzero offers a place for users to collaborate together to share information. The way that HUBzero promotes this feature is to encourage all users to upload their own presentations, tool, and other materials on the hub. The HUBzero software includes a self-service area that guides the user through a step by step process. On the first screen, the user inputs a title and an abstract, uploads associated files, then acknowledges a list of contributors for that particular project. The last step would be submitting the resources for posting. The hub is managed by the hub manager who approves all submissions and maintains the system in order to maintain the system’s integrity.  Once an item is published, new items automatically appear in the What’s New page of the hub.

## Tool Development Area
When users upload online presentations or a PDF document, the process is pretty straightforward; however, uploading a tool is a little more complicated. Tools must be created, uploaded, compiled, tested, fixed, complied again, and tested again until the user wants to have it published.  Also each hub comes with a companion site for source code development based on the open source package the user selects. Once the tool is published each tool will have its own project area within the Subversion repository for source code control, a ticketing system to track bugs and an area for project documentation.

## Ratings and Citations
The hub’s philosophy is not to judge a resource before you actually utilize it; therefore, the hub allows for registered users to post 5 star ratings and comments for each resource. The hub also allows registered users to post citations that reference the resource in the literature, so users can see other work that builds upon the resource. Citations and ratings are combined with web statistics to produce a number from 0 to 10 to measure popularity. As users would image, the resources with the highest ranking appear at the top of the list for searches and lower rankings are harder to come by on the hub.

## Content Tagging
Each resource on the hub is categorized by tags.  Tags are arbitrary strings defined by the uploader of the content. Tags have associated pages on the hub where its meaning is defined and its resources are listed.  For example, the tag “K-12” will help educators and students fine information related to elementary or secondary education. Tags are defined by the contributor and the hub manager and can be added by others after they rate the resource.

## Usage Statistics
The hub reports statistics about each individual hub showing the total number of users, hits, simulation jobs launched, and even down to the number of CPU hours used. The hub also reports how many users have accessed a tool, or how many times an online seminar has been viewed and the numbers are combined to provide an overview of interesting categories. For example, users can see how many people access a particular tool, how many are located in the US, and how many are working in education or industry.  These are just some of the categories and statistics that can be found on the hub but there are many more categories that can be found on the hub.

## News, Events and Feedback
Every hub comes default with a calendar, which allows any registered user to post events. This allows the hub to become a focal point of information for the community.  Each hub also has a news area, which allows the hub manager to post short stories that describe the progress being made by users. The hub also offers the user the opportunity to provide feedback.  Users can complete the feedback area where users can respond to poll questions or simply offer suggestions and feedback.
